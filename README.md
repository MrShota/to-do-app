This is my final project from Digital Industry Academy -  a course in Javascript.
This is my first big project and not easy, built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
In this - TODo App - project I get both user's and to-do data from the server(fake) and render it. Each user has his own to-do tasks, some are completed and some aren't. Also, you can add a new task, or remove or edit existing ones.
